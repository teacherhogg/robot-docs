The **Robot Dashboard** is an application running on a computer that is in communication with the robots.

Features of the Robot Dashboard include:

- Configure multiple robots (can control several robots at one time).
- Ability to Test Drive locally any connected robot.
- Ability to create and manage groups of people who can then be put into teams.
- Control which teams will drive which robots (multiple people can drive a single robot at one time).
- Choose amongst several [Challenge Modes](/challenge-modes) and start, run, and stop Robot Challenges.

Requirements of the Robot Dashboard computer include:

- Laptop or Desktop running Mac, Windows, or Linux (Cross-Platform).
- Needs to be setup with communication with the robots to be controlled. This is typically bluetooth, although could be directly wired as well (USB Cable).
- Internet access to get the commands being sent to the robots from participants (not required if test driving locally through the Dashboard).
