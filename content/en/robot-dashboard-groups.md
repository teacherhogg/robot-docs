Once installed and configured, you will need to define participants and teams (groups of participants).

If you go to the **Robots** tab, you will see the ability to select a **Group** and a **Challenge Name**. By default (using the default settings.yml file), you will be starting with the Group **testgroup** and the challenge **testchallenge**. You can start with these for now. See [settings.yml](/settings-yml) for how to define new groups. You may want to create a different group for each class or club that you may be running using Robot Coders.

If you go the **Teams** tab, you will see the ability to create new Teams (type into the 'New Team Name' and click +) and add participants (type into 'Firstname', 'Lastname', 'Username', 'Usercode' and click +).

<alert type="danger">
By default, the settings.yml file is setup with a very permissive mode whereby ANYONE can be added to the group simply by registering for a challenge. This makes it EASY to get started with a group, but is also dangerous as once students figure out how everything works they can (and will) start trying to drive robots when it is other's turns to drive! See the property testmode in settings.yml for more information.
