[Code.org](https://code.org) is an excellent online resource for teaching coding. Robot Coders is compatible with code.org and uses [App Lab](https://studio.code.org/docs/applab/) as a development environment for the student created [Robot Control Apps](/robot-control-apps).

Code.org's App Lab allows students to program in Javascript or Block Programming mode, or switch between the two.

Two sample apps on Code.org are provided as starting points. See [Quickstart Sample App](/robot-controller-quickstart-app) and [Controller Sample App](/robot-controller-sample-app) for instructions on how to access these sample apps.

Because the [Robot API](/robot-api) is based on HTTP GET calls, virtually any other programming language and programming environment can also be used (as long as 3rd party HTTP requests are allowed).
