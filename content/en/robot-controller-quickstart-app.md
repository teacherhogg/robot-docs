To quickly get started in **Robot Competitions**, you can make use of the [Sample Robot Control App available here.](https://studio.code.org/projects/applab/SOl1JwpRoae07HJdgOIt53Q2n9RsV9f5JVyQa1x_K8c) You can use this App as is on any platform or device (including phones, tablets, etc.).

If you want to modify the code for this app, you will need to create a free account on code.org and then import the app into your own project library. See [Sample Controller App](/robot-controller-sample-app) for instructions on how to get App into your own account (although note the app link in those instructions is for a different controller app!).

<alert type="warning">
This sample app is designed for quickly getting up and running with a group of participants so they can compete in Robot Challenges. It is recommended to not use this app if you are using Robot Coders as a part of a longer term course on coding and robotics. Note that this app is optimized for use with the Robot Dashboard running in testmode.
