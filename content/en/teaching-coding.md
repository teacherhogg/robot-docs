## Coding Concepts

The following coding concepts are extremely useful to cover for students if they are going to understand and modify their robot controller apps successfully:

- Datatypes
  - Strings and string literals
  - Numbers
  - Concatenation of strings
- Variables
  - Optionally cover concept of scope, global vs local.
- Functions
  - Optionally function parameters.

## Coding Environments

Here we are using [Code.org](https://code.org). However, the actual [Robot API](robot-api) is based on simple HTTP get commands, so virtually any programming language or development environment would work (as long as they support 3rd party HTTP calls).

Note that the coding environment is totally independent form the type of computer running the [Robot Dashboard](/robot-dashboard).
