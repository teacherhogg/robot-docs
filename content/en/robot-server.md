The **Robot Server** is an application designed to run on the [Cloud Application Platform Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).

The **robot-server-url** property in the **Robot Dashboard** Settings File [settings.yml](/settings-yml) specifies the web address of the Robot Server application. You may be able to use the default value. However, there may be limitations and you may need to deploy your own version using the source code on [Github](https://github.com/teacherhogg/robotchallenge). Note that the free tier on Heroku could easily be sufficient.
