Once installed and configured, you will want to test your Robots to see if they are communicating and configured properly before allowing participants to drive the robots.

Testing your Robots:

1. Go to the **Robots** tab and make sure the Robots you are ready to test are selected. Click on **Make It So!**.
2. If something is wrong, you will see ERRORS show up in Red at the top of the page. If everything is ready and OK, you will see the application switch to the **Teams** tab.
3. If the application switches to the **Teams** tab, switch now to the **Robot Testing** tab.
4. Choose the Robot you wish to drive and use the arrow buttons to test the basic forward, back, left, and right functionality of your robot. Note that if things are working properly, your robot should move in the direction specified for 1 second before stopping (should NOT keep running).

If all looks good, it is now time to **Setup Teams** and begin a **Robot Challenge**!
