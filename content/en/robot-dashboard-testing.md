Once installed and configured, you will want to test your Robots to see if they are communicating and configured properly before allowing participants to drive the robots.

Testing your Robots:

1. Go to the **Robots** tab and make sure the Robots you are ready to test are selected. Click on **Make It So!**. **WAIT a few moments to allow connections to be established and a response to be provided**.
2. If something is wrong, you will see ERRORS show up in Red at the top of the page. If everything is ready and OK, you will see the application switch to the **Teams** tab.
3. If the application switches to the **Teams** tab, switch now to the **Robot Testing** tab.
4. Choose the Robot you wish to drive and use the arrow buttons to test the basic forward, back, left, and right functionality of your robot. Note that if things are working properly, your robot should move in the direction specified for 1 second before stopping (should NOT keep running).

If all looks good, it is now time to **Setup Teams** and begin a **Robot Challenge**!

<alert type="info">
It is not uncommon to encounter an error when trying to establish a bluetooth connection to one or more robot. If that is the case, wait a moment and try again with ALL the same robots still selected you are trying to activate. The system will leave the existing connections for the working robots and simply try to re-establish a connection with the robots it had difficulty doing so. Generally connections work after at most 2 or 3 times. Make sure the robots are nearby and powered on.
