Once you have installed and configured the settings files you are ready to begin Robot Challenges controlled through the dashboard.

By default the [settings.yml](/settings-yml) file defines testmode to true. This mode is convenient to quickly get started. However, it is also not advised in general as it make it easy for savvy students to jump in at any time and start driving robots when they are not necessarily a part of the group or challenge.

## Open for Registration

When in teammode, you can click on **Open** to allow for open registration of any participant. The easiest way to do this is to use the App Studio Project Example created for this purpose.

Have participants go to [Robot Coder Quickstart Sample App](https://studio.code.org/projects/applab/SOl1JwpRoae07HJdgOIt53Q2n9RsV9f5JVyQa1x_K8c) on any device. They will need to click **Run** and then type in a firstname and username and click **Register**. You should see info banners (red) that tell you when each new user has registered. You will ned to refresh the Teams tab to add those members to a robot team (click on another tab and then return to the Teams tab).
