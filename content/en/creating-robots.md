Because the [Robot Dashboard](/robot-dashboard) uses the [Johnny-Five Robotics & IoT](http://johnny-five.io/) platform, it means there is a [huge range of supported boards](http://johnny-five.io/platform-support/) for any robot you may want to build.

The Sample Robots listed here are based on using an **Arduino UNO**.

A typical set of components for a Robot include:
