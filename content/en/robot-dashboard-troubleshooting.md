## Problems connecting to Robots

Here are some things to try:

- Try restarting the robots (unplugging and plugging in the Arduino power) and shutting down and restarting the Robot Dashboard.
- Make sure your Robot Batteries are fully charged.
- Try rebooting the Robot Dashboard computer and check the bluetooth connection (devices still paired).
