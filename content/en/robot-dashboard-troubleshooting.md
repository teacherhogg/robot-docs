## Problems connecting to Robots

Here are some things to try:

- Wait a moment and click on "Make It So" again with all the robots you are wanting connected still checked. The system will only try to re-establish connections with the robots not connected so far and will keep the valid existing connections. This often solves all issues after 2 or 3 tries.
- Try restarting the robots (unplugging and plugging in the Arduino power) and shutting down and restarting the Robot Dashboard.
- Make sure your Robot Batteries are fully charged.
- Try rebooting the Robot Dashboard computer and check the bluetooth connection (devices still paired).
