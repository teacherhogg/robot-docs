Uses YAML files to define.
When you first run the Robot Dashboard, it will require you to specify a **Settings Folder**.

The **Settings Folder** must inclue two settings files: 
* **settings.yml** This allows global settings for the application to be specified.
* **robots.yml** This is how you configure what robots are available.

When you first run the Robot Dashboard and specify an (empty) folder, examples for these two files will automatically be added to the folder. 

<alert type="info">
    Quick Start: You can typically leave the settings.yml file as is. However, you will need to edit the <span class="font-bold">robots.yml</span> file to configure for the robots you have available.
