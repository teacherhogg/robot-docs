When you first run the Robot Dashboard, it will require you to specify a **Settings Folder**.

The **Settings Folder** must incluse two settings files:

- **settings.yml** This allows global settings for the application to be specified.
- **robots.yml** This is how you configure what robots are available.

First, create a settings folder and then download the example **settings.yml** and **robots.yml** files from the [releases page](https://github.com/teacherhogg/robot-controller/releases).

<alert type="info">
    Quick Start: You can typically leave the settings.yml file as is. However, you will need to edit the <span class="font-bold">robots.yml</span> file to configure for the robots you have available.
</alert>

Click on the **Settings Folder Location** icon to specify the folder location.

<alert type="warning">
    You will need to shutdown and restart the application after specifying the Settings Folder location.
</alert>

See [robots.yml](/robots-yml) for how to configure settings for your Robots.
