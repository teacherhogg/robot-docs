Robot Control Apps are what participants will typically create, modify, and use to compete in [Robot Challenges](/robot-challenges).

A coding course or club using Robot Coders might include the following:

1. Introduce a coding environment. Here we are using [code.org and App Lab](https://code.org/educate/applab).
2. Introduce coding and cover various [core coding concepts](/teaching-coding#coding-concepts).
3. Introduce robotics and cover various aspects of robotics.
4. Introduce the [Robot Api](/robot-api) and show students a [Sample Robot Controller App](/robot-controller-sample-app).
5. Challenge students to create their own Robot Controller using App Lab.
6. Create a series of [Robot Challenges](/robot-challenges) where students will be given opportunities to modify and enhance their Robot Controllers.

Another option is to additionally include a unit on electronics and have students involved in the actual [building of the robots](/creating-robots).
